I am proud to announce the launch of [Prismocosm.com](https://prismocosm.com), the new face of my web development business. I have been building web pages and applications for clients going on 7 years now. I've always found new business simply by word of mouth recommendations. It's about time I have a professional brand I can advertise and grow.

I built Prismocosm.com from scratch with a single HTML and CSS file. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/harry-herskowitz/prismocosm). The backgrounds and borders use CSS gradients and keyframes. The animations are vector graphics I purchased and customized. The contact form runs on [web3forms](https://web3forms.com/), which takes the pain out of simple forms and comes with [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) to prevent spam.

As you can see, my personal site isn't flashy. My blog [design](https://harryherskowitz.com/2023/03/21/themeless-jekyll.html) is an ode to the old web, when amatuers designed sites full of personality with the limited styling options available. On the contrary, Prismocosm has all of the trappings of a sleek modern site made possible by advancements in CSS and SVGs. These two sites show the difference a small amount of code can make.
