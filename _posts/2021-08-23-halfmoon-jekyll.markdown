Welcome to Halfmoon-Jekyll! I made this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme using the [Halfmoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/docs/introduction/) front-end framework. It supports pagination, multiple authors, and dark mode.

I made Halfmoon-Jekyll in order to move my blogs away from Ghost - mostly so I could save money on servers, but also so I could have more control of my content. The design is inspired by the [Liebling](https://github.com/eddiesigner/liebling) Ghost theme.

Halfmoon-Jekyll is easily customizable thanks to Halfmoon's CSS variables. This site uses no JS aside from the dark mode toggle - which I feel very clever about.

Fork it on [Github](https://github.com/harry-herskowitz/halfmoon-jekyll) and hack away!
